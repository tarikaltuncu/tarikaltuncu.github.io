# Research Interests

My research interests lie where #Mathematics joins #Humanities on #Data. 
There has to be people and algorithms involved in. 

In general, I touch various subjects related to Natural Language, Graphs Theory, Network Community Detection, and People-Centric Data Science. 
Hint: I like the term Computational Social Science.
