[comment]: <> (https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

I am a PhD candidate at Imperial College London in Applied Mathematics.
I was graduated as an Electrical & Electronics Engineer from Bogazici University in 2014,
and MSc in Finance from Sabanci University in 2015.
I have been employed by a telecom network, a social data agency, and a global broadcaster for various positions.
I have worked as a marketing professional specialised in Digital Media, a project manager to build social CRM services for multinational companies, a data analyst for social data analytics for marketing and customer care, and a data scientist.
Currently, I am affiliated with a research group at Imperial College London and TRT Network's Audience Insights team.

# Research Interests

My research interest lies where #mathematics joins #humanities based on #data. 
There has to be people and algorithms involved in. 

In general, I like working on various subjects related to natural language, social networks, community detection, and data science.
